## Inspiration-

After we started investing in stocks, we being college students didn't have enough money  for monitoring
stocks with full-time brokers,so we started using discount-brokers for it.
But the stock prices keep on changing rapidly and there is no way to monitor them constantly using discount-brokers.So we decided 
to make a web app which would constantly monitor the stock prices and would notify the user if his profit percentage or loss percentage is reached.

## Implementation-

 1. Signup or signin to the website.
 2. Add the stock details.
 3. The stocks are being constantly fetched using finnhub.io.
 4. If the profit percentage is reached,a mail is sent to the user using Nodemailer.

### Tech
